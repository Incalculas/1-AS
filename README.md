# 1-AS
literally just the answer to my first sem computer science code, questions were made for python
PS stands for problem sheet. 

I will upload the solutions I submitted for grading or sometimes with changes made after submission.

The problems will be uploaded only 1 hour after the end of deadline

The level of description may vary depending on how committed I am to explain my solution
