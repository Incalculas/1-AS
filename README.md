# 1-AS

For the course CS1101:

I will upload the solutions I submitted for grading (sometimes with changes made after submission).
The problems will only be uploaded after the deadline.
The level of description may vary depending on how committed I am to explain my solution
This is for archival purposes for myself only, but is made public

1 in 1-AS stands for this being my first computer science course, A stands for assignment and S stands for solutions.
